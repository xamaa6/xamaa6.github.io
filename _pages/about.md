Welcome!
I’m Osama Nusair, a dedicated Cyber Security Researcher and Engineer with a deep passion for technology and safeguarding digital landscape. With specialized skills in Penetration Testing, Red Teaming, Application & Network Security, and Digital Forensics & Incident Response, I help organizations secure their systems and mitigate the latest cyber threats.

My expertise includes working on cutting-edge projects such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions that streamline threat detection, developing smartphone forensic tools for Android and iOS platforms, implementing honeypot strategies for edge network devices, and building Cyber Range platform for Red/Blue Team exercises and Capture-The-Flag (CTF) challenges. <a href='/projects'>Check out my projects here</a>

As a Founder of Cyber Security Startup <a href='https://airoverflow.com'>AirOverflow</a>, I’ve successfully led cybersecurity initiatives that enhanced security postures and reduced risks.

Looking ahead, I’m eager to explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity to develop smarter, more adaptive threat detection systems.

I’m always open to collaborating on cybersecurity projects or consulting on challenging security problems. Feel free to reach out via <a href='mailto:o.nusair@airoverflow.com'>o.nusair@airoverflow.com</a> or connect with me on <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/xamaa6'>Linkedin</a>.
