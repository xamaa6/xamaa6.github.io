This Capture the Flag (CTF) Platform was developed at <a href='https://airoverflow.com/'> AirOverflow</a> to provide a scalable, engaging environment for cybersecurity competitions. Built on the robust CTFd framework, this platform powers a wide range of CTF events, allowing participants to tackle real-world cybersecurity challenges and hone their skills. It has hosted multiple high-profile competitions, including the Pakistan Cyber Security Challenge (PCC) in 2022 and 2023, Cyber Siege CTF in 2022, and AirOverflow CTF in 2024, each bringing together skilled participants from diverse backgrounds to tackle hands-on security challenges.

<b> Tools & Technologies: </b>
<ul>
    <li>CTFd Framework: The core framework for the platform, CTFd provides a customizable and extensible base for creating and managing CTF challenges, user accounts, scoring systems, and leaderboards.</li>
    <li>Python & Flask: Python, along with Flask (the underlying framework for CTFd), enables rapid development and customization, providing flexibility for integrating features and modifying the platform to meet event-specific needs.</li>
    <li>Docker: For efficient deployment of challenge environments, Docker allows us to containerize individual challenges, ensuring isolated and scalable deployments across different infrastructure setups.</li>
    <li>Nginx & SSL/TLS Security: Nginx is used to serve the platform securely, with SSL/TLS encryption ensuring secure participant connections and a professional look for competition environments.</li>
    <li>MySQL: A reliable backend database that stores user data, challenge details, and event scores, ensuring fast and efficient data retrieval for large-scale competitions.</li>
</ul>
