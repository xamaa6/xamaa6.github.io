This project delivers a comprehensive toolkit for conducting digital forensic analysis on Android devices, supporting data recovery, evidence preservation, and filesystem analysis. It’s geared towards forensic investigators, cybersecurity professionals, and researchers working on mobile forensics, with a focus on automation and repeatable workflows.
<b> Tools & Technologies: </b>
<ul>
    <li>Python3: Used extensively for scripting and automating forensic processes. Python’s libraries enable efficient data parsing, pattern matching, and extraction, making it ideal for processing complex filesystem structures and recovering data from Android devices.</li>

    <li>Flask: A lightweight web framework that provides a user-friendly interface for accessing forensic tools and functionalities. Flask enables remote management of the forensic workflow, allowing users to initiate data recovery, view results, and manage analysis tasks through a web-based dashboard.</li>

    <li>Linux Utilities: Critical Linux command-line tools, such as dd (for creating forensic disk images), grep (for searching through files), and strings (for extracting readable text from binary files), are used to recover, preserve, and analyze data directly from Android devices, enhancing forensic accuracy.</li>

    <li>Linux Filesystem: The Linux filesystem serves as the foundation for storing and organizing forensic images and extracted data, ensuring reliable file handling, permissions management, and access to low-level device data. It’s essential for mounting Android filesystem images and examining specific files and directories for analysis.</li>

    <li>ADB (Android Debug Bridge): A key tool for direct communication with Android devices, enabling access to system files, application data, and logs crucial for digital forensics.</li>

    <li>SQLite Databases: Since many Android applications store user data in SQLite databases, understanding and analyzing SQLite is critical for recovering information from call logs, messages, contacts, and app-specific data.</li>
</ul>

<b> Key Features: </b>
<ul>
    <li>Data Recovery: Recovers deleted or inaccessible data from Android devices, including images, messages, and other files critical for investigations.</li>
    <li>Digital Forensic Imaging & Preservation: Ensures the integrity of digital evidence with imaging techniques that maintain data in its original state.</li>
    <li>Filesystem Analysis: Provides tools for analyzing the Android filesystem structure, allowing for in-depth review of file metadata, permissions, and hidden artifacts.</li>
    <li>Android Root Automation: Automates the rooting process to streamline access to secure files and system data, reducing manual setup time and minimizing errors.</li>
