<b> Key Features: </b>
<ul>
    <li>Scalable Virtualization: Built using Openstack and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the Cyber Range can scale dynamically, accommodating various network topologies and complex, multi-layered attack scenarios.</li>

    <li>Automated Deployment: Leverages Kola Ansible for automated deployment, reducing setup time and enabling rapid provisioning of training environments. This allows Red Teams to quickly adapt and reconfigure the environment for different training modules.</li>

    <li>Software Defined Networking (SDN) Integration: Incorporates SDN to create flexible, programmable networks that replicate a variety of network configurations, providing realistic testing grounds for network attacks and defenses.</li>

    <li>Customizable Attack & Defense Modules: Supports the addition of customizable modules for attack and defense exercises, enabling users to simulate different tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and improve their incident response capabilities.</li>

    <li>Isolated & Secure Training Environments: Ensures that all activities within the Cyber Range are contained and do not impact real-world networks, providing a safe space to test, learn, and refine cybersecurity strategies.</li>
